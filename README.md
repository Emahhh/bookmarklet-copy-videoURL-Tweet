## bookmarklet-copy-videoURL-Tweet

The `bookmarklet-copy-videoURL-Tweet` is a bookmarklet that enables you to easily copy the video URL from a tweet on Twitter. It's a quick and convenient tool that can be installed on your browser with a few simple steps.

### Setup
To get started, you need to create a new bookmark in your web browser. Then, copy the code from the `bookmarklet.js` file in this repository. You can access the `bookmarklet.js` file by navigating to the file in the repository and clicking on the "Raw" button to see the raw code. Copy the code and paste it into the URL field of your new bookmark.

### Usage
The bookmarklet can be used by clicking on the bookmark you created when you're viewing the page of the tweet that you want to copy the video URL from. 

For example, let's say you're on Twitter and viewing the page of a tweet. If you click on the bookmarklet you created, it will copy the video URL to your clipboard, which you can then paste into a new tweet.

When you paste the URL into a new tweet, the video will be shown without needing to reupload it. This is particularly useful if you want to share a video with your followers but don't have the original file or don't want to upload it again.

Please keep in mind that this bookmarklet only works if you are viewing the page of the tweet (the URL of the page must be in the format: `https://twitter.com/user/status/1625972614287032354`). It won't work on timelines, comments, or other areas of Twitter. This means that the tweet should be the only content on the page.
